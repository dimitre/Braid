# Braid — Roadmap

**Updated:** 2026-06-29
**Now:** v0.1.0 → **v0.2.3 core implemented and verified** (macOS/arm64). Surface is the
one primitive; algebra + self-feedback work; the ouroboros tunnel was captured to a file.
**Spirit:** a *fast* creative-coding microframework. Every milestone is a thing you can
**see/run**, not a pile of plumbing. If a step doesn't end in a demo, it's too big.

### Implementation status (2026-06-29)
- ✅ **v0.2.0 Surface pivot** — `Screen`→`Surface`; App draws into a persistent offscreen
  `Surface`, blitted to the swapchain at present. (`save()` later moved to braid-image, v0.3.0b.)
- ✅ **v0.2.1 Algebra** — `+=`, `over`, `zoom/rotate/shift/invert/multiply/clear`; total
  semantics (empty operand = identity; size/format absorbed by the blit).
- ✅ **v0.2.2 Self-feedback** — `surface.feedback(gain, transform)`, ping-pong hidden via
  an internal scratch+swap; accumulate (no `background()`) vs replace; `examples/feedback.cpp`
  verified (see scratchpad `feedback.png`).
- 🟡 **v0.2.3 Sketch tier** — 2D path + **3D wireframe `box()`** + perspective/camera, all
  through Surface. **Microframework port done** = `examples/cubes.cpp` (nested rotating
  wireframe lattice). Fixed: per-primitive uniform collision (hundreds of draws were sharing
  the 3-slot ring → now a fresh uniform buffer per primitive).
  **remaining:** real stroke outlines, **batching** (per-primitive vertex+uniform churn, review #4),
  `image()`, solid `box`/`sphere` fill.
- Examples: `hello`, `sketch`, `feedback`, `playground`, `cubes` — all build+run, all in `.zed`.
  Cmd+Shift+R runs playground; Cmd+Q/Esc quit; fps-in-title helper.

- ✅ **v0.3.0a Image load** — `Surface::load(path)` (mango SIMD decode → `WriteTexture`,
  single-copy). The texture object *is* a Surface, so loaded images compose with the whole
  algebra. `examples/image.cpp` verified (load→composite→readback round-trip pixel-identical).
- ✅ **v0.3.0b braid-image split** — `load`/`save` moved out of braid-core into the
  `braid-image` addon (`braid_image.cpp`), the first proof of the core-vs-addon architecture.
  **TGA removed from core**: `save()` now reads back + encodes by file extension (`.png`/`.jpg`/…)
  via mango's encoder; verified emitting a real 900×900 8-bit RGBA PNG. braid-core is now
  mango-free AND tga-free — the mango stack (mango + deflate/z/lcms2/zstd/bz2/lz4) links only
  where image I/O is used (`image`, `feedback`). Measured: pure-core sketches (cubes/playground/
  hello) ≈10.4 MB, 0 mango symbols; addon-linked (image/feedback) ≈14.25 MB, 1939 mango symbols
  — the ~3.8 MB codec stack is no longer paid for by sketches that don't load/save.
  `load`/`save` are *declared* in `braid.h` but *defined* in the addon (link-to-enable).
  Shared seam: `braid_detail.h` exposes `detail::ctx()` to addon TUs.
  **remaining:** sRGB color policy, `loadAsync`, `image()` placed-quad — see `braid_v0.3_textures.md`.

---

## North stars (the why, so the tasks don't drift)
1. **Surface is the one primitive.** You can only draw via a Surface; the screen is
   just the Surface you show. (Collapses Screen / image / video-out / feedback.)
2. **Two tiers, one vocabulary.** Fallible things (load, compile) return `Result<T>`.
   Expressive things (Surface algebra) are **total** — never error.
3. **Model the artist's mind, not the GPU's hazard.** Expose the ouroboros, hide the
   ping-pong. One knob (gain), not two buffers.
4. **Beautiful enough to just exist.** `surface += surface.transformed()` should
   compile and do the obvious thing. Define the algebra so guards are unnecessary.

---

## Architecture — core vs addons (what's the heart, what plugs in)

**The test:** *does the core need it, or does it need the core?*
Surface algebra depends on the GPU device — no WebGPU, no Surface, no `+=`, no feedback.
But Surface does not depend on audio, images, video, or MIDI: an image *becomes* a
Surface, audio *modulates* one, video is *Surfaces over time* — they reach toward Surface,
Surface never reaches back. So:

> **Anything that depends on the Surface but that the Surface doesn't depend on is an
> addon.** WebGPU fails that test (the core depends on it) → WebGPU is the heart, not an addon.

**Three layers, not a flat bag of plugins:**

| Layer | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **platform** | RGFW + Dawn (window + device, Metal surface) | the *floor* — always present, kept behind seams (swappable joint), never opted out |
| **core** | Surface + algebra + feedback + Compositor + the loop | the *heart* — this **is** Braid's identity; WebGPU is what it's made of |
| **addons** | image · audio · video · MIDI · text/fonts | *peripherals* — plug into the core, optional by **dependency weight** |

**Principles:**
1. **The core is *exactly* Surface + algebra + the loop. Everything else is an addon.**
   (Not "everything is an addon" — that hollows out the identity, the oF mistake. Strength
   is a small strong core + optional peripherals; the discipline is what you *refuse* to add.)
2. **Modularize by dependency weight, not feature category.** image earns a compiled
   module (mango + 7 codec libs) → `braid-image`, optional by simply not linking it.
   3D primitives have *zero* deps → a header in core, never a module. Don't ceremony the
   cheap stuff.
3. **WebGPU is already the abstraction — don't wrap it.** The only realistic "swaps" are
   other WebGPU impls (wgpu-native, browser under Emscripten), same API shape. A GPU-API
   layer over WebGPU is an abstraction over an abstraction: large tax, tiny win. Keep the
   *platform* specifics behind seams (window lib, Dawn-vs-wgpu, Metal glue) — that's where
   backend flexibility actually lives, and it's cheap.

**Module boundaries:** `braid-core` (no mango, no tga) ✅ · `braid-image` (mango
load/save) ✅ done v0.3.0b · later `braid-audio`, `braid-video`, `braid-midi`, `braid-text`
— each a chalet target you link only when you need it. braid-image is the template the rest
copy: declare the public entry points in `braid.h`, define them in the addon TU, reach core
internals through `braid_detail.h`, list the heavy archives only on the consuming target.

**Bumper sticker:** *Surface is the heart; everything that flows into or out of a Surface
is an addon; WebGPU is what the heart is made of.*

## ✅ v0.1.0 — Bootstrap (DONE)
- [x] RGFW + Dawn (WebGPU) on macOS; window, surface, device
- [x] `Screen`, `Shader`, `Mesh`, `App` loop, `Timer` (ofTimerFps), `Channel`, `Result<T>`
- [x] `hello.cpp` — red triangle
- [x] chalet build wired to the ofWorks/ofxDawn libs
- **Proof:** `presented 120 frames over 2.00s (60 fps)`, zero validation errors.

---

## v0.1.1 — Tidy-up (small, not blocking)
Window already shows and runs via `chalet run` — visibility is **not** a problem.
(The earlier black screenshot was just the fullscreen-terminal Space, not the app.)
So this milestone is minor polish, done whenever.
- [ ] 2–3 tiny examples (clear color, spinning mesh, mouse-follow)
- [ ] Resolve RGFW drag-and-drop crash (drop the flag cleanly, or patch/report upstream)
- [ ] **`braid::Key` enum + keycode mapping at the pump** — `KeyEvent.key` currently exposes
      the raw `ev.key.value` (braid.cpp:990), so sketches must compare against `RGFW_*`. Map
      to a Braid enum so RGFW stays a swappable joint (cheap now, expensive once sketches
      compare raw codes) *(review 06-29)*
- [ ] **Harden the Metal surface** — clear the `braid.cpp:909 [VERIFY]` tag once confirmed
      across resize + HiDPI; it's the platform code with the least margin *(review 06-29)*
- [ ] **Channel reentrancy** — callbacks fire under `cbMtx_` during `pop()`; a callback that
      (un)subscribes would deadlock. Snapshot handlers then fire outside the lock, or
      document the constraint *(review 06-29)*
- [ ] *(parked, trivial)* `.app` bundle = a `chalet distribution` section, like ofxDawn —
      nothing to design, do it when packaging matters
- **Proof:** a couple of runnable examples beyond the triangle.

---

## v0.2.0 — The Surface pivot (the identity work)
Write `braid_v0.2_surface.md` first (spec → critical-fixes → impl, the cycle that worked).
- [ ] Rename `Screen` → **`Surface`** (keep `braid::Surface`; `wgpu::` stays qualified)
  - 💬 **Opinion (review 06-29):** I'd have kept `Screen`. `braid::Surface` collides head-on
    with `wgpu::Surface` — the constructor literally takes a `wgpu::Surface` to build a
    `braid::Surface` (braid.h:257), and the two appear all over the same `.cpp`. `Screen`
    was unambiguous *and* matched the thesis ("the screen is just the Surface you show" reads
    fine with `Screen`). This is a real cognitive tax for everyone reading the code, including
    the LLM co-developer. **Not blocking, and I respect it's decided** — the chosen mitigation
    (always-qualify `wgpu::`) holds *if* enforced consistently; consider a clang-tidy/lint rule
    so it can't drift. If a rename ever feels cheap again, `Screen` is the lower-friction name.
- [ ] **All drawing routes through a Surface.** No bypass. `present()` → `show(surface)`;
      swapchain demoted to "the Surface you show"
- [ ] Surface duality: draw-into (`begin/end`) **and** sample-from (`asTexture`),
      usage `RenderAttachment | TextureBinding | CopySrc`; lazy allocation
- [x] `surface.save("frame.png")` via mango — done v0.3.0b (encode by file extension)
- **Proof:** draw scene → a Surface → both shown on screen *and* saved to PNG, same path.

---

## v0.2.1 — Surface algebra (the dream, made native)
- [ ] Total operators: `+=` (additive blend); consider `*=`, `-=` (all **total**)
- [ ] Total semantics — no guards, only definitions:
      uninitialized = additive identity · size mismatch = composite-at-origin/clip ·
      format mismatch = promote-to-richer
- [ ] Surface→Surface transforms (composable): `zoom`, `invert`, `rotate`, `shift`
- **Proof:** `a += b` with mismatched sizes/empty operands just works, never throws.

---

## v0.2.2 — Self-feedback (the ouroboros)
- [ ] One-surface self-feedback; **ping-pong hidden** under the hood
- [ ] `surface.feedback(gain, transform)` — weighted recurrence `s ← transform(s)·gain`
- [ ] Replace (`s = s.transformed()`, the tunnel) vs accumulate (`s += …`, the trails)
- [ ] Examples: invert-feedback (snake eating tail), 105% recursive zoom (tunneling)
- **Proof:** point Braid at itself — live video-feedback tunnels/mandalas at 60fps.

---

## v0.2.3 — Sketch tier complete (the Processing face)
- [ ] Finish `SketchApp`: stroke rendering, batching, `image()`, 3D (`box`/`sphere`)
- [ ] `pushMatrix`/`popMatrix`, camera/ortho/perspective fully wired through Surface
- [ ] **Port the old microframework sketch onto Braid**
- **Proof:** your previous bare-bones sketch runs unchanged-in-spirit on Braid.

---

## v0.3.0 — Media in / out
- [ ] `Texture::load` + `loadAsync` via mango (lib already present) — fast image decode
  - [ ] **Single-copy upload** (not "zero-copy" — impossible to discrete VRAM): mango decodes
        straight into a mapped `MapWrite|CopySrc` buffer at a 256-aligned stride with RGB→RGBA
        in-decode → `copyBufferToTexture`. Sync default uses `Queue::writeTexture` (no alignment
        rule). I/O thread decodes into the main-owned mapped pointer *(review 06-29)*
  - [ ] **Color policy:** sRGB/none → upload to an `-srgb` format (GPU sampler linearizes free);
        non-sRGB ICC → mango's bundled **lcms2** transform during decode. Expose the embedded
        profile so we can branch instead of always/never converting *(review 06-29)*
  - [ ] **Keep mango behind the `Texture` seam** — no `mango::*` type in any public signature
        (ofWorks `ofImage.cpp` already proves this pattern) *(review 06-29)*
- [ ] `Buffer` + async readback
- [ ] **Video record:** encode a Surface's frames over time (the funnel pays off again)
- **Proof:** load an image, remix it through Surfaces, record the result to a file.

---

## v0.3.x — Reach (pick per appetite)
- [ ] `ComputePass` — GPU particles (Dawn compute; ofxDawn has a reference)
- [ ] Text (SDF atlas) · Audio (rtaudio/miniaudio — libs in scaffold)
- [ ] Shader hot-reload (file watcher) — tightens the creative loop
- **Proof:** a million-particle compute demo; text on screen; a sound playing.

---

## Later / if wanted (not committed)
- [ ] Cross-platform: Linux / Windows (RGFW supports both; Dawn builds exist)
  - [ ] Linux deep-color reality check: verify `surface.GetCapabilities()` on the actual
        install/VP box (Wayland 10-bit/HDR is compositor-gated — *not* an RGFW-vs-GLFW thing,
        both are passthrough; the swapchain format is Dawn's call) *(review 06-29)*
- [ ] **High-bit-depth / Virtual Production output** — internal Surface is already `RGBA16Float` ✅.
      Add real 10/12-bit delivery: request `RGB10A2Unorm`/`RGBA16Float` swapchain via
      `GetCapabilities`; and a **`Playout` target distinct from window present** —
      `Surface → AJA NTV2 / Blackmagic DeckLink` SDI. Simple path: `copyTextureToBuffer` → map →
      card SDK (one frame latency). Fast path: GPUDirect DMA via Dawn native-interop (open
      question if worth it). Let the LED processor do the final dither; festivals dither to 8-bit,
      VP keeps the bits all the way out *(review 06-29)*
- [ ] **Web/Emscripten** — interesting because Dawn ≈ browser WebGPU; sketches in a tab
- [ ] Shared `libdawn.dylib` if shipping many sketches (move the ~10MB out of each binary)
- [ ] **iOS** — doable, but not free. Dawn's Metal backend runs on iOS, and `CAMetalLayer` works
      on `UIView`. The blockers are RGFW (desktop-only), the input model (touch vs mouse/keyboard),
      the app lifecycle (UIKit owns the run loop), and sandboxed file access. The right prep is to
      hide RGFW behind a `PlatformWindow` abstraction now so an iOS backend can be plugged in later
      without a rewrite.

## Sequencing rationale (1 paragraph)
Visibility is already solved (`chalet run`), so **v0.1.1 is just polish** and the real
next move is the **Surface pivot (v0.2.0)** — it comes before the Sketch tier grows so
there's less to refactor; it's the architectural spine. **Algebra → feedback
(v0.2.1–.2)** is the soul and should land while the design is fresh; it's also the
cheapest *wow* per line. Sketch-tier completion and media follow once the spine and the
soul are set. Compute/text/audio/cross-platform are reach goals, gated by appetite, not
dependency. Bundling, packaging, and similar are trivial chalet sections — do them when
they matter, not before. Resist any step that doesn't end in something you can show.
